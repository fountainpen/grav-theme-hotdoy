## What's new ?

**Notifications**

You can now create a page using the Notifications blueprint to add global or targeted notifications. Slug MUST be "/notifications". (Make sure you set ```routable``` and ```visible``` to ```False``` in the Advanced tab).

**Buttons**

Button ```btn``` and ```link``` shortcodes will now check page.media and act as download button when similar filename is found (with proper href).

## What's next ? 

**Font**

I am looking at **Inter** as an all around replacement. 

**Theme Marquee**

Probably refactor the theme marquee to work like Notifications.

**SEO**  

I am due for a full pass. Adding Schemas and stuff.

## Need a âœ‹ ?

If you need help with theme customization using theme inheritance (the only good way to do it), or if you want to sponsor a feature, PM me and we'll see what can be done! :D

# Hotdoy Theme

![Theme screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hotdoy/grav-theme-hotdoy/master/screenshot.jpg)

The **Hotdoy** Theme is meant to be my starting point for projects using [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav).
It is in active developpement and probably not suited for production unless you dont mind things changing all the times.
You can use this theme by simply downloading it but I recommend using the [skeleton](https://github.com/hotdoy/grav-skeleton-hotdoy) instead. If you use the skeleton, make sure to upgrade the theme and check if the demo content still display properly (It will probably not).

A live demo is available at [hotdoy.ca](https://hotdoy.ca). It is also my live testing ground so things can get a bit weird.

# Installation
Installing the Hotdoy theme can be done in one of two ways. The GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method enables you to quickly and easily install the theme with a simple terminal command, while the manual method enables you to do so via a zip file.

## GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this theme is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's Terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install hotdoy

This will install the Quark theme into your `/user/themes` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/themes/hotdoy`.

## Manual Installation

To install this theme, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/themes`. Then, rename the folder to `hotdoy`. You can find these files either on [GitHub](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-hotdoy) or via [GetGrav.org](http://getgrav.org/downloads/themes).

You should now have all the theme files under

    /your/site/grav/user/themes/hotdoy

# Customization 
All customization should be done using theme inheritance https://learn.getgrav.org/16/themes/customization#theme-inheritance to allow for future updates (and there will be updates). 

# Shortcodes

## Breakpoint
show content on specific breakpoint.
[portrait], [mobile] or [landscape], [desktop].

## Button
Add buttons with out without material icons. 
```
[btn href="https://google.com"], [link href="mypage" i="done"].
```
You currently have to use absolute url to page media but I am working on something way more solid. (should be in the next release)

## Embed
Add [youtube="url"] and [vimeo="url"] by URL.

## Note
Use [note] to add unrendered content.

## Material Icons
Add [mi="icon-name"](https://material.io/resources/icons/) with [i]

## Width
Use one of the 3 site witdh. [full], [site], [tight].

## Swiper
It currently has no options but I'll eventually do another pass.
```
[swiper]
![]()
![]()
![]()
...
[/swiper]
```
