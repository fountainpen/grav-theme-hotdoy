## A FAIR WARNING:

This theme is ever evolving. Things move around, major changes are made all the time, sometime requiring you take action. Use this as your own risk.

When extending this theme, you should use [Theme Inheritance](https://learn.getgrav.org/16/themes/customization). Create, overwrite or clone template you want to customize instead of trying to hack into mine. This way I can keep updating and you can keep the feature you care about. I hope we all have fun. Good luck :)

## What's new ?

**Custom Map icon**  
You can now upload a custom icon (pin) to be used by the Map modular. 

**Splash**  
Splash modular can now control where text wil be added (vertically and horizontally).

**Inter font**  
All fonts have been replaced with Inter. Yep. That's a big one. Your inherited theme should normally overwrite font.css and preload.html.twig if you want to change it.
Also, new font-size shortcodes are in for ```xsmall``` ```small``` and ```big``` markdowns.

**Notifications**  
You can now create a page using the Notifications blueprint to add global or targeted notifications. Slug MUST be "notifications". (Make sure you set ```routable``` and ```visible``` to ```False``` in the Advanced tab).

## What's next ? 
No new modular, no new page. I'll go trough the existing stuff, fix bugs, add features here and there and MAYBE start documenting stuff.

## Need a âœ‹ ?

If you need help with theme customization using theme inheritance (the only good way to do it), or if you want to sponsor a feature, PM me and we'll see what can be done! :D

# Hotdoy Theme

![Theme screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hotdoy/grav-theme-hotdoy/master/screenshot.jpg)

The **Hotdoy** Theme is meant to be my starting point for projects using [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav).
It is in active developpement and probably not suited for production unless you dont mind things changing all the times.
You can use this theme by simply downloading it but I recommend using the [skeleton](https://github.com/hotdoy/grav-skeleton-hotdoy) instead. If you use the skeleton, make sure to upgrade the theme and check if the demo content still display properly (it will not). I'm having a hard time finding the time to update the skeleton, Sorry.

A live demo is available at [hotdoy.ca](https://hotdoy.ca). It is also my live testing ground so things can get a bit weird.

# Installation
Installing the Hotdoy theme can be done in one of two ways. The GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method enables you to quickly and easily install the theme with a simple terminal command, while the manual method enables you to do so via a zip file.

## GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this theme is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's Terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install hotdoy

This will install the Quark theme into your `/user/themes` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/themes/hotdoy`.

## Manual Installation

To install this theme, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/themes`. Then, rename the folder to `hotdoy`. You can find these files either on [GitHub](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-hotdoy) or via [GetGrav.org](http://getgrav.org/downloads/themes).

You should now have all the theme files under

    /your/site/grav/user/themes/hotdoy

# Customization 
All customization should be done using theme inheritance https://learn.getgrav.org/16/themes/customization#theme-inheritance to allow for future updates (and there will be updates). 

# Shortcodes

## Breakpoint
show content on specific breakpoint.
[portrait], [mobile] or [landscape], [desktop].

## Button
Add buttons with out without material icons. 
```
[btn href="https://google.com"], [link href="mypage" i="done"].
```
You currently have to use absolute url to page media but I am working on something way more solid. (should be in the next release)

## Embed
Add [youtube="url"] and [vimeo="url"] by URL.

## Note
Use [note] to add unrendered content.

## Material Icons
Add [mi="icon-name"](https://material.io/resources/icons/) with [i]

## Width
Use one of the 3 site witdh. [full], [site], [tight].

## Swiper
It currently has no options but I'll eventually do another pass.
```
[swiper]
![]()
![]()
![]()
...
[/swiper]
```
