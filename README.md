## A FAIR WARNING:

This theme is ever evolving. Things move around, major changes are made all the time, sometime requiring you take action. Use this as your own risk.

When extending this theme, you should use [Theme Inheritance](https://learn.getgrav.org/16/themes/customization). Create, overwrite or clone template you want to customize instead of trying to hack into mine. This way I can keep updating and you can keep the feature you care about. I hope we all have fun. Good luck :)

## What's new ?

**Grid**

Grid Items can now be padded or not. Controlled from the Grid Modular.
This one is on my list. I'm refactoring the class system so expect it to break in the near future.

**Set content width using shortcodes**  

A new button has been added to the editor to add the tight and site shortcodes.

**Custom Map icon**  

You can now upload a custom icon (pin) to be used by the Map modular. 

## What's next ? 
* Articles and related templates are coming (blog)! 
* Grids are a mess si I'' go back to them.

## Need a âœ‹ ?

If you need help with theme customization using theme inheritance (the only good way to do it), or if you want to sponsor a feature, PM me and we'll see what can be done! :D

# Hotdoy Theme

![Theme screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hotdoy/grav-theme-hotdoy/master/screenshot.jpg)

The **Hotdoy** Theme is meant to be my starting point for projects using [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav).
It is in active developpement and probably not suited for production unless you dont mind things changing all the times.
You can use this theme by simply downloading it. If you use the skeleton, make sure to upgrade the theme and check if the demo content still display properly (it will not). I'm having a hard time finding the time to update the skeleton so I'm thinking about abandonning it and just focus on documentaing.

A live demo is available at [hotdoy.ca](https://hotdoy.ca). It is also my live testing ground so things can get a bit weird.

# Installation
Installing the Hotdoy theme can be done in one of two ways. The GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method enables you to quickly and easily install the theme with a simple terminal command, while the manual method enables you to do so via a zip file.

## GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this theme is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's Terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install hotdoy

This will install the Hotdoy theme into your `/user/themes` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/themes/hotdoy`.

## Manual Installation

To install this theme, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/themes`. Then, rename the folder to `hotdoy`. You can find these files either on [GitHub](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-hotdoy) or via [GetGrav.org](http://getgrav.org/downloads/themes).

You should now have all the theme files under

    /your/site/grav/user/themes/hotdoy

# Customization
