# Hotdoy Theme

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hotdoy/grav-theme-hotdoy/master/screenshot.jpg)

The **Hotdoy** Theme is meant to be a starting point for projects using [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav).
It is in active developpement and not suited for production at the moment.

A live demo is temporarily available at [hotdoy.hotdoy.org](https://hotdoy.hotdoy.org). (I dump the thing periodically).
